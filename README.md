Dumps "stems" from module files using [libopenmpt](https://lib.openmpt.org/libopenmpt/), made for the purposes of [misadventures in ludomusicology](https://www.youtube.com/@misadventuresinludomusicology).

The way this program works is stupidly simple â€“ it loops over every instrument in the module and mutes every other instrument. Beats opening up OpenMPT and rendering stems from every subtrack.

The only dependencies are [meson](https://mesonbuild.com/), [libopenmpt](https://lib.openmpt.org/libopenmpt/) and a C++20-capable compiler.
